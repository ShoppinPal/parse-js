Custom patches and updates to make Parse's JS SDK more robust for usage.

ShoppinPal is not affliated/associated/partnered with Parse. We are just a customer who subscribes to their service. At times, we find it easier to patch their latest source-code for the javascript client sdk by ourselves rather than wait.

The following header from Parse outlines the license/attributions and version we are working on top of to add patches and updates:
```
